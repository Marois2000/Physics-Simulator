# Physics Simulator Quiz Application

## Overview

This repository hosts a Physics Simulator Quiz Application built using React and Matter.js. The application challenges users with physics problems, requiring correct answers to balance the system. If users fail, the simulator runs, demonstrating the correct physics behind the problem.

## Introduction

### Purpose

The Physics Simulator Quiz Application aims to provide an engaging learning experience for users studying physics. By combining quizzes with a real-time physics simulator, the application reinforces conceptual understanding through interactive demonstrations.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React
- **Physics Engine:** Matter.js

### Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to leverage technology to enhance physics education. The interactive nature of the simulator makes learning more immersive and enjoyable.

## Application Features

### Quiz System

- Users are presented with physics problems to solve.
- Correct answers are required to balance the physics system.

### Physics Simulator

- Demonstrates real-time physics simulations.
- Displays correct outcomes for problems users fail to solve.

## How It Works

### Matter.js Physics Engine

The application utilizes the Matter.js physics engine to create realistic and interactive physics simulations. This engine enables accurate representation of physical phenomena, enhancing the educational value of the application.

### React Components

React components are structured to seamlessly integrate the quiz system with the physics simulator. Each problem presented in the quiz corresponds to a physics scenario simulated using Matter.js.

## User Interaction

### Solving Problems

1. Users attempt to solve physics problems presented in the quiz.
2. Correct answers allow users to proceed to the next question.

### Failing to Solve

1. Incorrect answers trigger the physics simulator to demonstrate the correct solution.
2. Users observe the simulated physics scenario to understand the correct principles.

## Collaboration
